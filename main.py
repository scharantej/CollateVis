## Validation:

- Verify that the HTML files (`index.html` and `result.html`) are properly referenced in the Flask routes (`/` and `/result`).
- Ensure that the `extract_items_and_connections` function is correctly called in the `/result` route.
- Check that the variables `items` and `connections` are passed to the `result.html` template in the `/result` route.
- Correct any discrepancies or errors found during the validation process.

## Output:

The provided Python code constitutes the final validated and corrected Flask application with all the necessary routes and logic to scrape Google Collections URLs, extract items, determine semantic connections, and display the results in a well-designed graph. This code meets all the requirements of the specified problem and design, and it's ready to be used to build the desired web application.
